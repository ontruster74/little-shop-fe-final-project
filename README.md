### Abstract:

This project takes an existing website that manages online merchant data and adds the ability to view promotional coupon data for said merchants. Each merchant listed on the website already had a designated coupon display, but this display contained no content or styling; the extra functionality I have built adds both using MVC design principles.

### Installation Instructions:

1. Clone this repo down to your machine.
2. Clone the corresponding backend repo down to your machine in a different directory: https://github.com/ontruster74/little-shop-be-final-project
3. Setup and run the backend repo using the instructions in its respective README
4. run $ npm install
5. run $ npm run dev

### Context:

I had a week to work on this project. I added functionality allowing this website to iteratively create and display Coupon objects for each merchant listed on the website based on fetched data.

### Learning Goals:

My learning goal for this project was to develop a solo working process for adding to an existing web application. I worked mostly with Ruby on Rails and Chrome dev tools.

### Wins + Challenges:
(What are 2-3 wins you have from this project? What were some challenges you faced - and how did you get over them?)

Wins:
1. I managed to complete all project requirements a day earlier than I expected.
2. I managed to get 100% line coverage with both my model and request testing suites.

Challenges:
1. I found it difficult to work on my own at first after having been in group environments for my last few projects. It became easier as I completed each phase of the project and saw how much I had accomplished at each phase.
2. I had some difficulty interpreting some of the assignment prompts, and kept second-guessing myself about code I had already written. I was thankfully able to clarify most of the development points I was unclear about with my instructors during office hours.
