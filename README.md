### Abstract:

This project takes an existing website that manages online merchant data and adds the ability to view promotional coupon data for said merchants. Each merchant listed on the website already had a designated coupon display, but this display contained no content or styling; the extra functionality I have built adds both using MVC design principles.

### Context:

I had a week to work on this project. I added functionality allowing this website to iteratively create and display Coupon objects for each merchant listed on the website based on fetched data.

### Learning Goals:

My learning goal for this project was to develop a solo working process for adding to an existing web application. I worked mostly with Ruby on Rails and Chrome dev tools.
